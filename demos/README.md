# Demos

This folder contains demo sites grouped under `/demos` for quick local and GitHub Pages preview.

Available demos:

- `/demos/azubel/` — Azubel demo homepage (moved from `/azubel`).
- `/demos/dmf/` — DMF demo homepage (moved from `/dmf`).

Notes:

- Each demo folder contains an `index.html` that will be served automatically by GitHub Pages when you visit `/demos/<name>/`.
- Original files were preserved under `.bak/` in case you want to restore them.
